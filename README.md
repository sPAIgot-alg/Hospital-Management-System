# Hospital-Management-System
This repository file represents the third semester project that I worked on in the year 2022. The project domain is based on Data Structures.

Abstract:
Our project Hospital Management System includes registration of patients, storing their 
details into the system, and also display all the appointments. The purpose of this study is 
to develop a computerized hospital management system that will upgrade the quality of 
information management and efficiency of the hospital employees using this study. It is 
accessible either by an administrator or receptionist. The data are well protected for 
personal use and makes the data processing really fast
